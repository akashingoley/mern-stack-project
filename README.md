# Shopper E-Commerce Platform with Admin Panel
## Tech Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
- **Frontend Development:** I crafted the Home page and various category sections for men, women, and kids, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The use of **React** allowed for the creation of a highly interactive and efficient frontend, enabling users to navigate through products effortlessly.
- **Admin Panel Implementation:** I designed and implemented an Admin panel that empowers administrators to effortlessly manage the platform's product inventory. Administrators can add, view, and remove products, enhancing the flexibility and control over the content available on the platform.
- **Backend Architecture:** **Node.js** served as the backbone for the backend, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure. The backend seamlessly interacts with **MongoDB**, where I structured the "Products" and "Users" tables to store product information and user data, respectively. This database architecture ensures efficient data retrieval and storage.
- **User Authentication and Cart Management:** To enhance the user experience, I implemented user authentication, enabling users to sign up and login securely. The cart details are associated with each user, ensuring a personalized shopping experience. Cart data is persistently stored, allowing users to seamlessly resume their shopping journey even after logging out and logging back in.
